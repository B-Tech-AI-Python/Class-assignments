    "### The knapsack problem\n",
    "The knapsack problem is an optimization problem that takes a common computational need—finding the best use of limited  resources given a finite set of usage options—and spins it into a fun story. A thief enters a shop with the intent to steal.\n",
    "He has a knapsack, and he is limited in what he can steal by the capacity of the knapsack. How does he figure out what to put into the knapsack?"

    "### Brute-Force Approach\n",
    "If we tried to solve this problem using a brute-force approach, we would look at every combination of items available to be put in the knapsack. For the mathematically inclined, this is known as a powerset, and a powerset of a set (in our case, the set of items) has $2^{N}$ different possible subsets, where $N$ is the number of items. Therefore, we would need to analyze $2^{N}$ combinations $(O(2^{N}))$. This is okay for a small number of items, but it is untenable for a large number. Any approach that solves a problem\n",
    "using an exponential number of steps is an approach we want to avoid. "

    "### Dynamic Programming\n",
    "Instead, use a technique known as dynamic programming, which is similar in concept to memoization. Instead of solving a problem outright with a brute-force approach, in dynamic programming one solves subproblems that make up the larger problem, stores those results, and utilizes those stored results to solve the larger problem. As long as the capacity of the knapsack is considered in discrete steps, the problem can be solved with dynamic programming."
